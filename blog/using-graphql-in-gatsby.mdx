# Using GraphQL in Gatsby üîç

Gatsby uses **GraphQL** to fetch and manage data from multiple sources like Markdown files, APIs, and CMSs.

## Why GraphQL?
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Request only the data you need.
- **Single Query Language**: Unifies multiple data sources.
- **Built-in in Gatsby**: No additional setup required.

## Example Query
Here's a simple GraphQL query in Gatsby:

```graphql
query {
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
